            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS no man ought to presume to enter into any office Ecclesiasticall without an inward calling from God, who only discerneth the intentions, and desires of the heart, whether they be earthly or heavenly, whether they be set upon the glory of God, and edifying of the Church, or upon the means of this life; So
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51043:3"/> none are to be admitted without the approbation and judgement of men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Word, and the received order of the Church.</p>
            <p>This outward calling of the Officers of the Church doth consist in Election and Ordination, after due triall and examination of their soundnesse in religion, and godlinesse of life: For the better understanding of the order of the calling of Ministers, it is to be considered,</p>
            <p>That in every one almost of the <hi>Classes,</hi> or great Presbyteries, there be Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Divinity; wherefore some, if they have opportunity of their Studies, make their abode within the bounds of the Presbytery, and attend the meetings thereof: Others, who are the greater part, stay at the Vniversities, and in the time of vocation come home and wait upon the Presbytery.</p>
            <p>The abilities of both the one sort and the other, are to be tried in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presbytery, and how soon they are found fit to come in publike, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the exercise or prophecy with the Ministers of the Presbyrety, and at somtimes employed and allowed to preach before the people: By which means their gifts and abilities are knowne to the people, as their manners are manifest by their conversing amongst them.</p>
            <p>Out of the number of these Proposants, or (as you may call them) <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants,</hi> the Pastor is to be nominated to the vacant place by the Eldership, and by the Minister, if any be, with the consent and good liking of the people, and if they can pitch upon none within the bounds of their own Presbytery, to have their liberty to make their choice of an <hi>Expectant</hi> of good esteem and report in some oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Theme: And at the same time a publike E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict must be served, That if any person or persons, have any thing to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the literature, doctrine, or life of such a man, why he may not be a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Minister of such a Congregation, They shall appeare before the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in such a place, &amp; at such a time, that their objections may be tried &amp; discussed.</p>
            <p>Vpon the day appointed, the Doore-keeper of the Presbyterian meeting is to call three severall times, if there be any thing to object against the person nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51043:3"/> and if any thing be alledged against him by any of that particular flock, or any other to whom he is known, it is duly and equally to be pondered by the Presbyterie, and if it be found to have any weight, or the case be doubtfull, the Ordination is suspended to a more perfect triall; otherwise, if there be nothing but silence, to proceed.</p>
            <p>So that by this means no man is obtruded upon the people, against their open or tacite consent and approbation, or without the voices of the particular Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, with whom he is to serve in the Ministerie. But if the person nominated be a Pastor of some other flock, and his faithfulnesse known in his former charge, this Processe is spared, and his Translation more speedily expedited, if there be no impediments of another kind.</p>
            <p>Vpon the day appointed for accomplishing his election, and for his Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is in due time to be made known to the Congregation, and agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them, a Fast ought to be ordained to be kept, with more then ordinary supplication, for the assistance and blessing of God, in a worke of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: and one of the Pastors of the Presbyterie is appointed to preach to that people, of the mutuall duties of Pastor and People: all which being done, the party (during the time of the exercise of publike Worship sitting in some conspicuous place before the Pulpit with the Elders, and some Ministers of the Presbyterie) is to be called and demanded concerning his willingnesse and desire to serve the Lord Jesus, for the good of that people; with other questions of that kind: and the people also are to be demanded, whether they will receive him for their Pastor, and submit themselves unto his Ministerie in the Lord. Both having declared their readinesse and mutuall consent, the Minister coming from the Pulpit, with so many Ministers present as may conveniently come neare, lay their hands upon his head, and in the Name of Jesus appoint him to be Pastor of that People, praying that from Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and giveth gifts unto men, he may finde the demonstration of the Spirit, and the power and blessing of God in his Ministerie, to the comfort of that People: after which, the whole Eldership give unto him the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship. Last of all, the Minister going to the Pulpit, is to conclude with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thanksgiving and prayers, and a Psalme being sung, the Assembly dismissed with a Blessing.</p>
            <p>The Congregation, where he who is presented is to serve, is called, if they have ought to object against his Doctrine or life, after they have heard him, or that their consent may be had: and if he be found <hi>Reus ambitus,</hi> or to have gone about to procure a presentation, he is to be repelled, and declared incapable of that place. No Pastor may thrust himselfe upon a flock, nor after his entry, desert his charge, or remove himselfe to another Congregation at his own pleasure. The deserters, if any be, are appointed to be admonished, and in case of obstinacie, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51043:4"/> be excommunicated. If a Mintster, upon lawfull and urgent causes, desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one Congregation to another; or if a Minister be called from one Congregation to another, for which he is more fit, or be called forth upon grave considerations, for some publike imployment, tending to the common benefit of the Church; this is not done by private transaction, and particular agreement, of Ministers and Congregations, but by the wisedome and authority of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries or Assemblies of the Church; nor is it done by them, but upon such reasons as should move that Church, wherein for the present he administreth, to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er consent: for whose supply also, either a convenient course is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, or the way of supply is seen to be easie.</p>
            <p>The Minister thus removed from one Church to another, receiveth no new Ordination, but by vertue of his first Ordination serveth in the place, unto which he is called and elected: Only at his admission one of the Presbyterie, who is appointed to preach of the dutie of Pastors and people, and to pray for a blessing, recommendeth him to the Congregation, who have before declared their willingnesse and desire to receive him, and the Congregation to his care and fidelity; and the Pastor, if any be, together with the Elders, with whom he is to sit before the Pulpit, take him by the hand. Pastors and Ministers of the Word, through old age, sicknesse or other infirmitie being disabled to beare the weight, and discharge the dutie of their Pastorall charge, do notwithstanding still retaine the honour of their office, and comfort of mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tenance during their life time: And they performing what they are able, in teaching, government, visitation and catechising, others are joyned with them by the Presbyterie, with with the consent of the people, to be their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After Sermon, the Pastor praiseth God, and prayeth again for a blessing, with earnest Petitions for the Church Vniversall, and for the coming of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, for all the afflicted Churches, for the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The matters treated by this Eldership, are such particulars as concerne the worship of God in that Church; as, what dayes of the week are meetest for assembling to the publike Worship, if it may be had, and be thought necessary, what houres on the Lords Day, before and after noone, which are variable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length, or shortnesse of the day, in Summer and Winter; what times are fittest for publike catechising, and for visiting of particular families; how often, and at what times, the Lords Supper is most seasonably to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred: all which are fitting for keeping of order in the Church, and cannot be so fitly determined by a superiour Assembly; the Elders also do here delate scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous persons, and bring them to publike repentance, according to the Forme prescribed in the greater Assemblies: but if there be any doubt or difficulty, or if the delinquents add obstinacie and impenitencie to their fault, then are they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to appeare before the greater Presbytery, there to receive order for their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or to be sent home again to give satisfaction, or to make their repentance in their own Church where they have given offence, and where the fault was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: For example, a man behaving himself scandalously with a woman, both unmarried and single persons, is first admonished and rebuked; if fornication appeare, he is called before the Eldership, brought to the sense and confession of his fault, and ordained to make his publike repentance, according to the order of the Church, and to abstain from all scandalous behaviour afterward.

               <p>But this not admission to the Communion is one thing, and excommunication of haynous or obstinate offenders, is another thing very different.</p>

               <p>If any person walke unworthy of the Gospel, or commit any trespasse, he is (unlesse the scandall be publike and notorious) admonished first secretly by one, next by two or three more; and thirdly, if he contemne both, then according to the order prescribed by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. The matter is brought before the Minister and Elders, where he is accused both of the trespasse and of the contempt.

               <p>As all publike penitents are received, so is the excommunicate absolved in the face of the Congregation, before whom being brought by the Elders at the time appointed, he maketh free confession of his sinne and mourneth for it, cryeth to God for mercie, seeketh to be reconciled to the Church and promiseth new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; with which all being satisfied, and willing to receive him into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and mutuall consolation, the Minister who preacheth for that time pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him upon his repentance to be absolved in the Name of Christ from his sin, and free of the censures of the Church, and have right through faith to Christ and all his benefits and ordinances, praising God for his grace, and praying that he may be fully accepted to his favour, loosed in heaven, and heare the voice of joy and gladnesse.</p>

               <p>THe Provinciall Synod is of the same constitution with the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and doth consist of all the Ministers, and one Elder having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as before, from each particular Church within the Province. It meeteth ordinarily twice a yeere, but the place and the time of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are chosen according to the conveniency of the Churches of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and as the exigence of their affaires doth require. The Moderator of the former Synod openeth the Synod with a Sermon fit for such an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and after Sermon setting himselfe downe in his place, with the Clerk of the Synod (who for the most part is one of the Ministers chosen by plurality of voyces) beginneth with prayer, causeth the names of the Ministers to be read, who not only answer for their own presence (the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent being noted) but also give up the names of the Commissioners from the severall Churches, which are written down by the Clerk, and their Commissions also read, if need be, and proceedeth to the chusing of a new Moderator. The Moderator is thus chosen.</p>
               <p>A list is made by the former Moderator of foure or five of the ablest men for wisdom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uthority and dexterity for such an employment which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the consent of the Synod. And if any Member of the Synod be pleased to adde any other so qualified to the list his name is joyned with the former, and out of this list the Moderator is chosen by the suffrages of the Ministers and Elders, and set in the place of the former Moderator.</p>
               <p>The new Moderator first of all calleth for the Registers of the severall Prdsbyteries, and putteth them in the hands of the Ministers of other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Presbyteries to be revised and examined, That by the Reeords it may be knowne how they have kept order. and performed what hath been<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended unto them by the preceding Synods. And what and how matters have beene treated by them at every session, that they may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured or allowed, which upon the report of the revisers is accordingly done in the face of the Synod.</p>
               <p>If there be any references from the Synod before, they are first debated and determined, and thereafter new matters are brought into deliberation. What was obscure or difficult for the Presbyteries, or might concerne them all in common, is here resolved and ordered, what hath beene done amisse is redressed. And if any difficultie arise which doth not fall under some Church constitution, it is referred to the nationall assemblie.</p>
               <p>Before the Assemblie be desolved, each Presbyterie is set a part by course and enquirie made from the rest, if there be any knowne scandall, fault, or negligence amongst them. That it may be in a brotherly manner censureb like as upon the day of the meeting of the Prsbyterie next going before the Synod; all the members of the Presbyterie suffer the like inquirie each one a part by all the rest.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51043:12"/>
               <p>As the Moderator beginneth and endeth everie Session before and after noone with prayer, so doth he somewhat more solemnly close the Synod with some pithy and pertinent exhortation, and hearty thanksgiving and prayer unto God.</p>
               <p>All matters where these Synods are ordinarily kept are with such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be expedited, that the Ministers (none of them having above a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And thanks may be given in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for the good proceedings of the Synod, and for the liberty of the Churches. These Synods are not alwayes held at one time, and therefore if there be cause, some Commissioners are sent from one Synod to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their judgement a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So upon the other part, no scandall of proud sinners escapeth censure, no heresie or errour is sooner hatched, but is presently spied out and crushed by some of the inferiour Assemblies, or, if it be kept on foot and gather strength, it is quite suppressed and extinguished in the generall Assembly, which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once in the yeere, and never suffereth such bastard births to grow to be one yeere old, which is a true and maine cause why no Sects nor Errors have appeared in the Reformed Church of France, and in the Churches of Scotland and of the Low-Countries, so long as they enjoyed the libertie and happinesse of Assemblies, which they did no sooner by the mercie of God recover, but immediately at their brightnesse, the mists and mildews gathered before were scattered and vanished. And as by the order and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of these Assemblies, Foxes are taken that they spoile not the Vines, and Gangrenes are prevented that they spread not against truth and unity, all sorts of lewd and wicked men are discouraged and put to shame: So is there excited among the godly Ministers an holy emulation by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conference, and by perceiving the gifts one of another, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them returne from the Assemblies with a meane and humble conceit of themselves, and with new and strong resolutions for greater diligence in their studies, and faithfulnesse in every Pastorall dutie, to the common benefit and edification of all the Churches; all the Ministers are made more wise in matters of Government; and all the Congregations are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with reverence to what is required of them by their particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships, as having the consent and approbation of the whole Church. Many such fruits are reaped of these Assemblies, which witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here there is a superiority without tyrannie, for no Minister hath a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or Monarchicall jurisdiction over his his owne flock, far lesse over Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and over all the Congregations or a large Dioces. Here there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without confusion and disorder, for the Pastors are in order before the Elders and the Elders before the Deacons; the Church is subordinate to the Presbyterie, the Presbyterie to the Synod, and the Synod to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Assembly. One Pastor also hath priority before another, for age, for zeale, for gifts for his good deservings of the Church, each one honouring him whom God hath honoured, and as he beareth the image of God, which was to be seene amongst the Apostles themselves. But none hath power or jurisdiction above others; even as in nature, one eye hath not power over another, onely the head hath power over all, even as Christ over his Church. The same may be seene in the Common-wealth, and in some of the offices of the Roman Church it selfe.
